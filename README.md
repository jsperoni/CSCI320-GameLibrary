Add a `rit_credentials.py` file at the root of this repo and add in the following variables

```
username = ""
password = ""
```

These values should be your CS account username and password, not the general RIT credentials

When making your python virtual environment make sure to name `.venv` or something else (will need to update the `.gitignore` if you do) so we dont track thousands of files
